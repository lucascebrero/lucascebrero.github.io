I'm Lucas, aka czx. I have a curious mind and love learning about new things.

Understanding how things work is what fuels me. Working as a Pentester/Security Consultant allows me to constantly explore new technologies on a day-to-day basis. I also have a lot of fun playing around with my homelab, which I see as a great complement for getting hands-on experience and understanding how different technologies fit together.

I've been working in Cybersecurity since 2015. I started as an intern in the public sector as a Security Analyst, helping the security department establish policies and working closely with the infrastructure team to set up services securely.

For about a year, I also worked as an IT admin as a side gig, where I researched big data technologies to help plan a potential infrastructure migration. I also helped research embedded devices for vehicle tracking, something I knew nothing about at first, but ended up really enjoying.

From 2020 onwards, I've been working on pentests and security assessments, mostly focused on web applications. From time to time, I've also been lucky enough to get involved in different type assessments including mobile.

 In between pentests I try finding something interesting to do research on. I'm pretty much down for anything that sounds fun and challenging.
